# Cell2Cell
Reducing Churn rates for Cell Phone Company
This final project is based on the Cell2Cell case, which was a churn modeling game that groups worked on to see who could get the best lift based on their modeling and also come up with managerially relevant recommendations for proactive churn management.

These questions will help you frame your analysis appropriately:

  Suppose you can build a model to predict churn (say, a regression type model, where the dependent variable is likelihood of churn). What do you think will be the key factors that will predict churn?

  Check the list of variables available in the data set description â€“ can any of these predict churn? Why?

  What incentive offers should be made to which customers to encourage them to remain with Cell2Cell?

  How can one be sure that the actions recommended based on the predictive model will work?

The Cell2Cell Churn Modeling.pdf is the final deliverable (slides for presentation).
